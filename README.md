# Studio Ghibli DB
This is a work in progress. This project was aimed towards me practicing utilizing API and connecting projects to APIs to recieve information. 

**Link to project:** https://studio-ghibli-db.netlify.app/

There is no image since site is under construction

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project is heavily focused on Javascript and using my code to connect to API and receive and display back information. Since this was the focus there was no real HTML or CSS used except the bare minimum to display the page and test that my request were working.

## Optimizations

This project needs real work aesthetics-wise. Ramping up the HTML and CSS and maybe even using React would elevate this site and take it to the next level.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the basics of using promises and async requests through fetch requests to an API.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
